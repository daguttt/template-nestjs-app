# Template NestJS Monorepo

We're using [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) (a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable and scalable server-side applications) with [monorepo mode](https://docs.nestjs.com/cli/monorepo) to allow us to share logic between our services and scale easily.

Paths:

- /apps/api: Backend for FrontEnd, a RESTful API for web apps.
- /libs/common: Common utilities and services.
